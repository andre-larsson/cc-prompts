# Creative Interpretation Mode (Optional)

**DO NOT use this mode by default. Only when explicitly requested by user.**

## When to Create Creative Interpretations

Only create when user explicitly requests creative interpretation with phrases like:
- "Create a Claude version"
- "Make your own interpretation"
- "Fill in the missing sections creatively"

## Creative Interpretation Process

1. Save as `results/artist_songname_claude.txt`

2. **Begin with comprehensive musical analysis before tablature:**
   - Analyze harmonic progression and key modulations
   - Identify rhythmic patterns and groove characteristics
   - Discuss melodic opportunities and counterpoint possibilities
   - Explain creative choices and arrangement decisions
   - Detail specific techniques to be employed (walking bass, ostinatos, etc.)

3. Fill in missing bass parts or create alternate interpretation

4. Design musical bass lines that complement the song's style and feel

5. Include different approaches:
   - Walking bass
   - Melodic counterpoint
   - Rhythmic variations
   - Harmonic substitutions

6. Maintain the original chord progression but explore creative bass movement

## Important Notes

- This is NEVER the default behavior
- Always create the research-based version first
- Only proceed to creative version if explicitly requested
- Make it clear in the file that this is a creative interpretation, not the original
