## Implementation Notes
- Consider rate limiting and API keys where required
- Some sources may need authentication
- Prioritize sources with public APIs or RSS feeds
- Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Blocked Sources (Attempted but Failed)
These sources were implemented but are blocked by anti-scraping measures:
- **Product Hunt** - Cloudflare 403 Forbidden
- **Hashnode** - GraphQL API authentication issues
- **AngelList/Wellfound** - Cloudflare protection, requires browser automation

To access these sources, would need:
- Browser automation (Selenium/Playwright)
- Official API keys
- Proxy rotation services
