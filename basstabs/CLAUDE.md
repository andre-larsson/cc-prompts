# Bass Tabs Generator - Simple Instructions

## Your Job
Create accurate bass tablature for songs by researching existing tabs online and formatting them properly.

## PRIORITY: Accuracy Over Everything

**The #1 goal is getting the RIGHT NOTES and CHORDS. Format comes second.**

### Quick Accuracy Checklist
Before saving any transcription, verify:
1. ✓ Did you use WebSearch to find multiple sources?
2. ✓ Does the bass pattern match what most sources show?
3. ✓ Are the chords varied (not all the same)?
4. ✓ Does the pattern have musical variety (not just 2-2-2-2-2)?
5. ✓ Did you verify against known patterns? (e.g., "Come As You Are" = 0-0-1-2)

## Simple 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Research
1. **Use WebSearch** for "[song name] bass tab" AND "[song name] chord progression"
2. **Find chord charts separately** from bass tabs (Ultimate Guitar, Chordify, etc.)
3. **Look for consensus** - if 3+ sources agree on a pattern, it's probably right
4. **Verify famous songs** against known patterns:
   - "Come As You Are" (Nirvana) = 0-0-1-2 pattern
   - "Another One Bites the Dust" (Queen) = E-E-E-G-E-A pattern
   - "Seven Nation Army" (White Stripes) = E-E-G-E-D-C-B pattern

### Step 2: Identify the Bass Pattern Type

**Match the pattern to its style** (this helps verify accuracy):

#### Pattern Recognition Tips:
- **1950s-60s**: Usually walking bass or simple root-fifth
- **1970s rock**: Often root-octave or pedal tones
- **1980s pop**: Syncopated roots, octave jumps
- **1990s grunge**: Simple root notes, occasional chromatic
- **Modern**: Mix of all patterns, genre-dependent

### Step 3: Transcribe What You Found
1. **Label chords from your chord research** - NOT from bass notes
2. **Include slash chords when bass note differs from root** - e.g., C/G for C major with G in bass, Am/F for A minor with F in bass
3. **Use Research-Based Mode** (default) - transcribe the bass patterns that you found
4. **Review chord progression and tabs** - if its a famous song where you are sure of the actual chord progression, verify that transcription is correct, sometimes research finds the wrong or too generic tabs
5. **Convert to 5-string bass format** (B-E-A-D-G tuning)
6. **Include only documented sections** - don't fill in gaps

### Step 4: Save and Verify
1. **Save as:** `results/artist_songname.txt`
2. **Final checks:**
   - Chords change throughout the song? ✓
   - Bass pattern matches consensus from research? ✓
   - Pattern matches the genre/era? ✓
   - No overly repetitive patterns? ✓

## Red Flags to Avoid

### These are ALMOST ALWAYS WRONG:
- **Single chord for entire song** (e.g., all Em)
- **No chord changes in chorus**
- **Overly repetitive patterns** (e.g., 2-2-2-2-2-2-2-0 for whole song)
- **Bass note = chord name** (bass often plays 3rds, 5ths, not just roots)

### Common Mistakes:
- Creating patterns that "seem right" but aren't in the actual song
- Determining chords from bass notes alone
- Repeating one chord or bass note throughout song when actual song is more varied

## File Format (Keep It Simple By Default)

### DEFAULT: Simple Format (unless otherwise instructed)

Your output file should have **MINIMAL** information:

1. **Brief Header**: Artist, song title, key (e.g., "Key: C Major" or "Key: A minor"), tempo
2. **Section 1**: Basic chord progression
3. **Section 2**: Bass tablature (only what you found)

**DO NOT include** (unless specifically requested):
- Detailed metadata (album, year, musicians, producer, label)
- Song analysis paragraphs
- Bass player profiles
- Extended performance notes
- Detailed legends

Use 5-string format (B-E-A-D-G):
```
G|---------------------|
D|---------------------|
A|--3---5---7---5------|
E|---------------------|
B|---------------------|
  Am
```
