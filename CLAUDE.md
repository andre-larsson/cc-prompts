# CLAUDE.md

Instructions for Claude Code when working in this repo.

## What's in this repo

Just my personal Claude Code prompts for different projects. Each folder has its own thing going on.

## How it works

Each folder has its own `CLAUDE.md` with instructions for that specific task. Just:

1. Start Claude Code in the folder you want
2. The local `CLAUDE.md` tells Claude what to do
3. Any needed files are already in that folder

## Current stuff

- `basstabs/` - Makes bass tabs for songs

Look in each folder for more info.
