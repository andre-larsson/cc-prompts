# Claude Code Prompts (Personal Use)

My collection of Claude Code prompts for various hobby projects.

## What's This?

Just a repo with prompts for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Each folder has its own setup for different tasks.

## Structure

```
cc/
├── basstabs/     # Bass guitar tablature generation
└── ...           # Additional projects
```

## How to Use

1. Go to the folder for what you want to do
2. Run Claude Code there
3. The `CLAUDE.md` file tells Claude what to do

## Projects

### Bass Tabs (`basstabs/`)
Makes bass tabs for songs I want to learn:
- Looks up tabs online
- Outputs as text files
- Creates alternate versions
- 5-string bass format
- Just for practice
