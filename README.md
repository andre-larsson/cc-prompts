# Claude Code Prompts (Personal Use)

My collection of Claude Code prompts for various hobby projects.

## What's This?

Just a repo with prompts for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Each folder has its own setup for different tasks.

## Structure

Each folder contains a self-contained project with its own `CLAUDE.md` instructions.

## How to Use

1. Go to the folder for what you want to do
2. Run Claude Code there
3. The `CLAUDE.md` file tells Claude what to do
