      "summary": "In recent years, large language models (e.g., Open AI's GPT-4, Meta's LLaMa,\nGoogle's PaLM) have become the dominant approach for building AI systems to\nanalyze and generate language online. However, the automated systems that\nincreasingly mediate our interactions online -- such as chatbots, content\nmoderation systems, and search engines -- are primarily designed for and work\nfar more effectively in English than in the world's other 7,000 languages.\nRecently, researchers and technology companies",

While extreme-scale language models such as GPT-3 offer\nmultilingual capabilities, zero-shot learning for languages other than English\nremain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Cedille, a large open source\nauto-regressive language model, specifically trained for the French language.\nOur results show that Cedille outperfo",
