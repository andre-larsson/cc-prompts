# Technical Details Reference

## Standard Bass Tablature Layout
Bass tablature uses a modified version of guitar tablature with 5 strings:
- String names are written on the left (B-E-A-D-G where B is the lowest pitch and G is the highest)
- Lines represent strings, not frets
- Numbers on lines indicate which fret to press
- Number 0 represents an open string (nut)
- This document uses pitch order convention (highest pitch string at top)

## Tablature Symbols

**Essential Playing Techniques:**
- h = hammer on, p = pull off, / = slide up, \ = slide down
- ~ or v = vibrato, b = bend string up, r = release bend
- PM = palm mute, * = natural harmonic, x = muted note
- t = tap, s = legato slide, N.C. = No chord (rest)
- Additional symbols preserved as found in source tabs

## Converting Informal ASCII Tabs

When you find high-quality tabs in informal formats (like user-submitted ASCII tabs):
- Extract the musical content (fret numbers, techniques, timing)
- **DO NOT determine chord progressions solely from bass notes** - use researched chord charts
- Convert to 5-string bass format (B-E-A-D-G) if needed
- Expand shortened notation (e.g., "repeat main riff" becomes full tablature)
- Add measure bars based on time signature (every 21 characters for 4/4)
- Include chord labels below each measure
- Preserve special techniques (slides /, bends b, hammer-ons h, etc.)
- Credit the original transcriber in the sources section

## Transposition and Capo Handling

- Identify the original recorded key
- **CRITICAL: Always check for capo usage in source material**
- **If capo is present, transpose ALL chords and fret positions to remove capo**
- Example: Capo 4th fret â†’ transpose everything up 4 semitones (Am becomes C#m)
- Show actual fret positions without capo in the tablature
- Update key signature to reflect actual recorded pitch (not capo key)

## Key and Scale Information

Always specify:
- Key signature
- Scale type (major, minor, modal)
- Chord function (I, vi, IV, V, etc.)
- Suggested bass note emphasis

## Song Structure Elements

Transcriptions follow the actual arrangement of the original recording, which may include:
- INTRO
- VERSE
- PRE-CHORUS
- CHORUS
- BRIDGE
- SOLO
- BREAKDOWN
- OUTRO/CODA
- INTERLUDE

Structure varies by song and artist.
