        "text": "Everyone's obsessed with building the next \"Devin\" or some god like autonomous agent. It's a huge waste of time for 99% of developers and businesses.\n\nAfter spending the last 18 months in the space building these things for actual clients, I can tell you the pattern is painfully obvious. The game changing agents aren't the complex ones. They're basically glorified scripts with an LLM brain attached.\n\nThe agents that clients happily pay five figures for are the ones that do one boring thing perfectly:\n\n- An agent that reads incoming support emails, categorizes them, and instantly replies to the top 3 most common questions. This saved one client from hiring another support rep.\n- A simple bot that monitors five niche subreddits, finds trending problems, and drafts a weekly \"market pain points\" email for the product team.\n- An agent that takes bland real estate listings and rewrites them to highlight the emotional triggers that actually make people book a viewing.\n\nThe tech isn't flashy. The results are.\n\nThis is the part nobody advertises:\n\n1.  The build is the easy part. The real job starts after you launch. You'll spend most of your time babysitting the agent, fixing silent failures, and explaining to a client why the latest OpenAI update broke their workflow. (Pro tip: Tools like Blackbox AI have been a lifesaver for quickly debugging and iterating on agent code when things break at 2 AM.)\n\n2.  You're not selling AI. You are selling a business outcome. Nobody will ever pay you for a \"RAG pipeline.\" They will pay you to cut their customer response time in half. If you lead with the tech, you've already lost the sale.\n3.  The real skill is being a detective. The code is getting commoditized and AI coding assistants like Blackbox AI can help you prototype faster than ever. The money is in finding the dumb, repetitive task that everyone in a company hates but nobody thinks to automate. That's where the gold is.\n\nIf you seriously want to get into this, here's my game plan:\n\n- Be your own first client. Find a personal workflow that's a pain in the ass and build an agent to solve it. If you can't create something useful for yourself, you have no business building for others.\n- Get one case study. Find a small business and offer to build one simple agent for free. A real result with a real testimonial is worth more than any fancy demo.\n- Learn to speak \"business.\" Translate every technical feature into hours saved, money earned, or headaches removed. Practice this until it's second nature.\n\nThe market is flooded with flashy, useless agents. The opportunity isn't in building smarter AI; it's in applying simple AI to the right problems.\n\nWhat's the #1 \"boring\" problem you think an AI agent could solve in your own work?\n\n",

      "content_preview": "AI Browsers promise a future where an Agentic AI working for you fully automates your online tasks, from shopping to handling emails.

Yet, our research shows that this convenience comes with a cost: security guardrails were missing or inconsistent, leaving the AI free to interact with phishing pages, fake shops, and even hidden malicious prompts, all without the human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s awareness or ability to intervene.

This is the new reality we call \" Scamlexity \" - a new era of scam complexity , supercharged by Agentic AI. Familiar tricks hit harder than ever, while new AI-born attack vectors break into reality. In this world, your AI gets played, and you foot the bill. Welcome to Scamlexity AI Browsers are no longer a concept. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. Microsoft has Copilot built into Edge. OpenAI is experimenting with a sandboxed browser in \u00e2\u0080\u009cagent mode.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Perplexity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the idea of a browser that browses for you. This is Agentic AI stepping directly into our daily digital routines - searching, reading, shopping, clicking. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just assisting us, but increasingly replacing us. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a frightening paradox. In the rush to deliver seamless, magical user experiences, something critical is left behind. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put it plainly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne small step for Agentic AI, one giant step back for our security!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The problem isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just that these browsers are UX-first. They also inherit AI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built-in vulnerabilities - the tendency to act without full context, to trust too easily, and to execute instructions without the skepticism humans naturally apply. AI is designed to make its humans happy at almost any cost, even if it means hallucinating facts, bending the rules, or acting in ways that carry hidden risks. That means an AI Browser can, without your knowledge, click, download, or hand over sensitive data, all in the name of \u00e2\u0080\u009chelping\u00e2\u0080\u009d you. Imagine asking it to find the best deal on those sneakers you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been eyeing, and it confidently completes the purchase\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 from a fake e-Commerce shop built to steal your credit card. The scam no longer needs to trick you. It only needs to trick your AI. When that happens, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still the one who pays the price . This is Scamlexity : A complex new era of scams, where AI convenience collides with a new, invisible scam surface and humans become the collateral damage . Falling for the Same Old Tricks To reach the above conclusions, we first had to take these AI Browsers for a test drive in the security lane . We chose Perplexity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Comet as our primary test subject. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently the only publicly available AI Browser that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just summarize or search, but actually browses for you , clicks links, and performs tasks autonomously. Our first step wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to unleash cutting-edge, AI-targeted exploits. We started simple \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with scams that have been running for years. Humans have learned to spot them (and here at Guardio , our detection engine eats them for breakfast), but what would an AI Agent do when faced with the same traps? A Fake Shop Selling Fake Apple Watches to your AI Agent One of the most hyped features of AI Browsers, often shown in promo clips, is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy me something\u00e2\u0080\u009d routine. With a single prompt, the AI will search the shop, select your product, and check out. And so, one AI prompt on Lovable was all it took to spin up a convincing \u00e2\u0080\u009cWalmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d store to test drive Comet on. The site had everything: a clean design, realistic product listings, and a checkout flow good enough to pass a casual glance. Looks like the folks at Lovable still haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read our VibeScamming report showing how missing guardrails in their models can play straight into scammers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hands and harm the public on an unprecedented scale. In our scenario, the human reaches this fake shop the same way many do today: Through misleading social media ads, spam emails, or SEO poisoning in search results. On Comet, the page loads without issue and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blocked by Google Safe Browsing, even though G",

Subscribe What makes an AI more or less agentic A quintessential agentic system has: Goals Planning Multi-step reasoning Memory and/or persistence Interaction with the outside world Given a goal, an agentic system constructs a plan for how to approach it, has some ability to work through (and update) its plan in a loop, can effectively employ its own output along the way, and has some interaction with other systems in ways that aren\u2019t fully mediated by a human user. Agentic systems vary on how deep they go on each dimension. Example design of an agentic system. Boundaries could be fuzzy in the case reasoning LLMs, where some aspects could be internal to the LLM, external to it with a supervision loop, or both. Similarly, memory can come in many forms, including the context window, structured or unstructured logs or task lists, document access, or integrated parameters \u00e0 la Wang et al. (2023) [1]. To illustrate this more concretely, contrast a powerful coding agent against a human coder who has a chatbot open either inside or outside of their IDE. Once assigning a task to the coding agent, it may: create a step-by-step plan, generate new code, execute and test the code, ingest error messages, and repeat this process until succeeding. Meanwhile, a human coder with a chatbot may repeatedly insert code from the chatbot into their editor, but the human decides when to edit or run the code and which step to take afterwards. The human is far more involved compared to using the coding agent. \u201cAgentic\u201d is an adjective, and need not be a binary one. We can describe the agenticness of a system. The coding agent is fairly agentic, while a chatbot that only has text input and output is not very agentic. 1 We can test this framework by considering how agentic a reasoning LLM is. With a suitable prompt that explains our task, it could construct a plan, loop through multiple iterations of generating a suitable answer, and effectively use its own prior output as the context for subsequent iterations. Those are all dimensions of agenticness. But unless we trust it with some form of automated interaction with the outside world, it\u2019s just a fancy chatbot. It\u2019s more agentic than a weak and non-reasoning LLM, but its effect on the world is mediated through the human using it. I define \u201cagenticness\u201d as how much dynamic capability a tool has between steps of human supervision . A chatbot might have very little dynamic capability (it might only output text) and the human-in-the-loop cycles are tight (the human reviews the text after each answer). A coding agent has substantial dynamic capability (it can make large code changes across multiple attempts, interacting with the editor and/or the command line) and the human-in-the-loop cycles are wide (the human reviews the code after substantial changes). Why tools matter LLMs have substantial capabilities even without external tools. They have an incredible amount of compressed information combined with many specific and general abilities . But those LLMs that can\u2019t use any additional external capabilities will forever have limitations. The most obvious limitation is the information cut-off. The base model of an LLM is trained on some corpus and cannot know all details of the future beyond that corpus. 2 If I ask an LLM who won today\u2019s baseball games, that LLM can only know that information by accessing some up-to-date resource. Similarly, toolless LLMs are at a severe disadvantage for predicting upcoming weather. 3 Information cut-offs are one reason we need external capabilities, and not the only one. Consider performing basic math. LLMs learn some math through memorization and can solve select other computations through reasoning loops around learned mathematical principles, but that\u2019s a lot of capability to learn compared to just having access to a precise calculator. Web search, weather services, and calculators are several types of tools for accurately answering questions. Those are, conceptually if not literally, read-only tools with no side effects. We might also want LLMs to be able to perform the equivalent of write actions, intentionally affecting the world. 4 You could have LLMs filter your emails, or even respond to them. Or reorder the items on your todo list and place reminders on your calendar. There\u2019s no limit to the uses people could want. Those who want to entrust agents with wide human-in-the-loop cycles will need to grant some tool control to those agents. Function calling as a canonical pattern Most tools concep",
